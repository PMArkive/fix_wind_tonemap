# Fix Wind/Tonemap Carryover

This plugin fixes env_wind & env_tonemap_controller settings carrying over into other maps without those entities. Currently it depends on an extension, however it will likely be included in base SourceMod soon.

## Requirements

- [SMExt-EntityLump](https://github.com/nosoop/SMExt-EntityLump) (compiled bins available in this repo)
